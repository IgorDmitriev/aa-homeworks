      <h1>Rustic Smoked and Sour Soup - Solyanka</h1>
      <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
      <p>Solyanka is a traditional Russian rustic smoked and sour soup,
        where a surprising combination of smoked meats and acidic liquids
        come together. What gives this soup its ultra fab smoky flavor are
        the hard rock variety of smoked meats like ham, salami, sausage
        and bacon, while the pickles, olives and lemon juice bring out
        the mild tartness.</p>

      <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place beef in a soup pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and add bay leaves with peppercorns.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until fork tender. Then remove the meat and let cool.</li>
        <li>Add onion and carrot to the hot skillet with olive oil and saute until soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce, season with salt and pepper and cook on low for 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice the cooked beef, discard the bones and add meat back to the pot together with the tomato sauce, pickles and the rest of diced smoked cuts.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, add smoked paprika and season with salt and pepper. Then reduce heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and add chopped parsley, olives and lemon juice. Let Solyanka rest covered for at least 20 minutes before serving to develop the flavor.</li>
        <li>Serve garnished with lemon slices and dollop of sour cream.</li>
