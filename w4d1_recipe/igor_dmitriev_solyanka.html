    <h2>Description</h2>
    <a name="description" />
    <p>Solyanka is a traditional Russian rustic smoked and sour soup,
      where a surprising combination of smoked meats and acidic liquids
      come together. What gives this soup its ultra fab smoky flavor are
      the hard rock variety of smoked meats like ham, salami, sausage
      and bacon, while the pickles, olives and lemon juice bring out
      the mild tartness.</p>
